![Overall Dashboard View with Filters](http://googleusercontent.com/run-storage/uploaded:Screenshot%202025-06-24%20014019.png-b2ebb794-7156-4bec-94a7-374960063027)

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for **News Sentiment Analysis and Clustering**, guiding you from raw data acquisition to an interactive, insightful dashboard. The process meticulously covers:

1.  **Collecting raw news article data** from a public dataset.
2.  **Filtering** this data to a specific date range (2015-2024).
3.  **Creating a filtered CSV file and backing it up to an AWS S3 bucket.**
4.  **Downloading this filtered data from S3** for subsequent cleaning and text preprocessing.
5.  **Developing machine learning models** for content understanding.
6.  **Calculating sentiment scores** and persisting all processed data and models into a PostgreSQL database.
7.  **Building an insightful Streamlit dashboard** for interactive exploration of news sentiment and article clusters.

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Source

The project utilizes the "NYT Articles (21M+, 2000-Present)" dataset available on Kaggle.
To download, use the Kaggle CLI command: `kaggle datasets download -d aryansingh0909/nyt-articles-21m-2000-present`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.8+**
* **PostgreSQL Database:** A running PostgreSQL instance is required to store the processed data and the ML model.
* **AWS Account:** For utilizing S3 for raw data storage and retrieval.
* **Kaggle API Key:** To download the dataset programmatically if you prefer not to download it manually.

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following packages:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    wordcloud
    nltk
    psycopg2-binary
    sqlalchemy
    plotly
    seaborn
    streamlit
    boto3
    python-dateutil
    pytz
    joblib
    ```
    Then install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **NLTK Data Downloads:**
    The `model.py` script automatically checks and downloads necessary NLTK data (`punkt`, `wordnet`, `stopwords`, `vader_lexicon`) when run.

---

## üîê Configuration

1.  **AWS Credentials (`.vscode/secrets.json`):**
    If you plan to use AWS S3 for data storage, create a `.vscode` directory in your project root and inside it, create a `secrets.json` file with your AWS Access Key and Secret Key:
    ```json
    {
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY": "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY",
        "AWS_SECRET_KEY": "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
    }
    ```
    > ‚ö†Ô∏è *Do NOT commit this file to public repos! Consider using environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager for production environments.*

2.  **PostgreSQL Credentials:**
    The Python scripts use environment variables for PostgreSQL connection details. Set the following environment variables:
    ```bash
    export DB_HOST="your_db_host" # e.g., localhost
    export DB_NAME="your_database_name" # e.g., mdte16db
    export DB_USER="your_username" # e.g., postgres
    export DB_PASSWORD="your_password"
    export DB_PORT="5432" # Default PostgreSQL port
    ```
    Ensure your PostgreSQL database (e.g., `mdte16db`) exists and your user has the necessary permissions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage - Step-by-Step Pipeline

Follow these steps to run the complete news sentiment analysis and clustering pipeline:

1.  **Collect and Filter Raw Data:**
    Download the dataset from Kaggle manually or using the Kaggle CLI, and place `nyt-articles-21m-2000-present.zip` in the project root. Then execute `data_collection.py` which will collect and filter the raw data for the period 2015-2024.
    ```bash
    python data_collection.py
    ```

2.  **Upload Filtered Data to AWS S3 (Backup):**
    This step creates a `raw_data.csv` file with the filtered data and uploads it to your configured AWS S3 bucket for backup purposes.
    ```bash
    python aws_upload.py
    ```

3.  **Download Data from AWS S3 for Processing:**
    Retrieve the `raw_data.csv` from your S3 bucket. This file will then be used as input for the data cleaning and subsequent steps.
    ```bash
    python aws.download.py
    ```

4.  **Perform Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    This script processes the downloaded `raw_data.csv` to clean the data and prepare it for model development.
    ```bash
    python data_cleaning.py
    ```

5.  **Develop Models, Calculate Sentiment, and Store in DB:**
    This script performs crucial steps including text preprocessing, K-Means clustering, and VADER sentiment analysis. It then pushes the final processed data, along with sentiment scores and cluster assignments, to the PostgreSQL table `news_data_processed`. It also stores the trained machine learning models in the `ml_models` database table.
    ```bash
    python model.py
    ```

6.  **Launch the Insightful Dashboard!**
    Start the interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize and explore the news sentiment and article clusters.
    ```bash
    streamlit run data_visualisation.py
    ```
